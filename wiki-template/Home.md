## Useful links - Wiki features

This wiki uses the [Markdown](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) syntax. 

1. The [MarkDown Demo tutorial](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) shows how various elements are rendered.
2. This 5min video shows how to use markdown for creating [issues](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKJ4RdhyB5Y).
3. The [GitHub documentation](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/wiki/) has more information about using a wiki.
4. This video shows how can you use [Project boards and issues](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nI5VdsVl0FM&list=PLYMgErMHWi1PRMTsHXote19b7f9F-JjmT&index=2&t=1s) to integrate agile methodologies for working in your team.
5. Documentation on [wikis](https://docs.github.com/en/github/building-a-strong-community/documenting-your-project-with-wikis) by github.

The wiki itself is actually a git repository, which means you can clone it, edit it locally/offline, add images or any other file type, and push it back to us. It will be live immediately.

Go ahead and try:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/COMP90054-2021S2/YOUR-REPO-NAME.wiki.git
```

Wiki pages are normal files, with the .md extension. You can edit them locally, as well as creating new ones.

## Syntax highlighting


Here's an example of some Python code:

```python

def wiki_rocks(text):
    formatter = lambda t: "funky"+t
    return formatter(text)
```


You can check out the source of this page to see how that's done. Just clone the wiki and get inspired to start your own project wiki.


Have fun!
